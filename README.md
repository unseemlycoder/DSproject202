Problem Statement
Program to handle router (network related) table using the relevant data structures

Approach
Making use of a graph to represent a network topology with each node consisting of routers. Each router can handle certain number of devices, these devices have their own IP address, Sub net masks, and other related network preferences.
Usage of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between two clients or routers.

Data Structures Used
Graphs (Adjacency list and Matrix implementation) and Linked List
